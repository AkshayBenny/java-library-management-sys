### Documentation of the inheritance relationship/hierarchy requirements

There is a super class in my library management system named LibraryResource. I included common fields like title, description, author, isAvailable, genre, resourceId, etc. to reduce repetition. The subclasses PhysicalResource and ElectronicResource inherit these fields. Electronic resources include journals, ebooks, and PDF files, while PhysicalResource class represents books. By including more parameters and methods like fileSize and isDownloadable that are typical of ebooks, PDF files, and other types of files, the ElectronicResource class expands the capabilities of LibraryResource. Similarly, the PhysicalResource class adds new data members such as damages, dimensions, shelf position, etc. as well as methods to expand their capabilities.
